 This folder contains optional Utils. If you do not want to use them, simply exclude to folder from build.
 Currently CommandLineInterpreter can be used only with CommandLineInterpreterThread, which requires a multithreading
 environment. CommandLineInterpreter itself can be used in single threaded environment. In this case a ISR for serial
 connection should concantenate the string. Once string is concantenated, a pointer to it should be attached to a message
 which is sent to the CommandLIneInterpreterHandler (not implemented). Sending a message required because
 CommandLIneInterpreter should not work in the ISQ for two reasons: it takes time and it sends messages to Handlers using
 Queue.send() and not Queue.sendFromIsr().
